This project takes the top 100 songs during the specified year-month-day from billboard, and we get the 100 songs URL by passing the name of the song as string to spotify.
Once the urls are stored in a list we use that as an input to create a playlist of 100 songs that were the most listened to during the year/day you specified.
This can be used to get the top 100 songs that were famous say maybe in the year 2010 and bring back a lot of nostalgic memories, with your past relationships, friends, family, etc. Dont forget to Have fun, Thank you.
